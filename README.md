# NAME: " Urसेवा " - you provide, you avail

# OBJECTIVE
We all know that this time period of pandemic has effected every business in some way or the other. So many businesses have shut down, thousand of people have lost their jobs, hundreds of people are finding it difficult to run their home. The objective of creating this web portal is that people of all professions- be it a plumber, a carpenter, an electrician, a printer, a media person, a delivery man or any person who provides basic essential services as well as services which an indivisual or a company requires, pool in their services and help each other. We know that there are so many people who earn on a daily basis and run their home and these are the ones who have suffered the most. Its an alternative to lessen their burden and tension and help them earn by providing services to anyone and everyone who is in need of the service they provide, depending upon their preference of area where they would want to deliver their service. This web portal also focuses on less people moving out of their homes or only those moving who are in need of.

# IMPLEMENTATION
Implementation of this web portal is through web development skills. We would be having a portal wherein a person has a choice to register as a service provider or a service availer. If a person chooses to provide a service, he/she would be asked to fill out a form asking for their general details including the service they would like to provide and their preferred area for delivering services. In case the person wants to avail a service they would have to again register and browse through the available options of services and the service providers according to their residence.

# APPLICATION
In the current situation of COVID-19 pandemic, this would help service providers get more clients to work for and earn their daily wages to survive this dreadful and traumatic condition. Even when this pandemic would not be there and everything will go back to normality, service providers could still use this portal and easily get new clients and build better relations with more number of people which would be beneficial for their respective businesses. This would create a safe working environment with fruitful interactions and people would not have to move their hands here and there to search for a service, instead they can just visit the portal and find one.

# FUTURE EXPANSION: 
We would look forward to convert this into a mobile app and would try and tie up with various companies who provide these services in addition to the individuals who were earlier providing these service., This would help expand the business circle as well as act as an advertisement for the companies. It would work as a healthy business cycle where everyone helps every other.
